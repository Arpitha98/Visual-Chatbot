Jama Masjid
"A jama masjid (Persian: مسجد جامع‎), also known as a congregational mosque or Friday mosque,  is a type of mosque which is the main mosque of a certain area that hosts the special Friday noon prayers known as jumu'ah. They also host the Eid prayers in situations when there is no musalla or eidgah available or nearby to host the prayers.


== Etymology ==
Jama masjid or jame masjid comes from the Persian term masjed-e jame (مسجد جامع‎), from the Arabic language
term masjid jāmi‘ (مَسْجِد جَامِع‎), meaning ""congregational mosque"" . In Arabic, the term is simplified to jāmi‘ (جَامِع‎).
In non-Arab Muslim nations, the word jāmi‘ (""that which gathers, congregates or assembles"") is often conflated with another word from the same root, jumu‘ah (Arabic: جُمُعَة‎, lit. 'assembly, gathering'), a term which refers to the Friday noon prayers (Arabic: صَلَاة الْجُمُعَة‎, romanized: ṣalāṫ al-jumu‘ah, lit. 'prayer of assembly') or the Friday itself (Arabic: يَوْم الْجُمُعَة‎, romanized: yawm al-jumu‘ah, lit. 'day of assembly'). This is due to the fact that the jumu'ah prayers require congregations and are only held in congregational mosques, usually the main mosque or central mosque of a town or city, and hence they are also sometimes known as Friday mosques.The term is rendered similarly in transliterations from other languages, such as jame mosque, jami masjid, jameh mosque, jamia masjid, or jomeh mosque.
